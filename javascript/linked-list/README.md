# Singly Linked List

> Can be defined as the collection of ordered set of elements. The number of elements may vary according to need of the program. A node in the singly linked list consist of two parts: data part and link part. Data part of the node stores actual information that is to be represented by the node while the link part of the node stores the address of its immediate successor.

## Challenge

>this code challenge required to define class node and class Linked List and create a new linked list and use three methods for that.

 1. (insert)

* first, when being ll empty.
* second when being ll not empty)

2. (includes)

* a method for search if this node found in this ll or not.

3. to string

----

## Approach & Efficiency

>in code, I declared variables and use compare operations and insertion for the linked list then Time ***Complexity Equal Î˜(1)***, and ***Space Complexity Equal  O(n)***.

## API

* Insert
* Delete
* Search
* append
