3. added after the specific node.

## Approach & Efficiency

>I have implemented the linked list in a Class approach, where each of the list methods is a method of the class, creating a new linked
and I create three methods for insert

* append()
* insertBefore()
* insertAfter()
* and use the while loop and if statement.
