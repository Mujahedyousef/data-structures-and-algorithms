# Trees

>A tree is a data structure where a node can have zero or more children.

* Type of trees:-

1. Binary tree : Each node maximum up two children
1. Binary search tree :

* node value in Right >node value in Left
* Each node maximum up two children

## Challenge

## Required

1. Creating a Binary Tree class
Define a method for each of the depth-first traversals:

* pre-order
* in order
* post order
 which returns an array of the values ordered appropriately.

 2. Creating a Binary Search Tree class
This class should be a sub-class of the Binary Tree
add two methods:

* add
* Contains

## Approach & Efficiency

In the code, I used  two classes
and  constructors
in the methods, I use the if statement and while loop and recursion.

* per_Order():Big O(n^2)
* in_Order():Big O(n^2)
* post_Order():Big O(n^2)
* add():Big O(n)
* Contains():Big O(n^2)

## API

Used this methods:

* push
* per_Order()
* in_Order(
* post_Order()
* add()
* Contains()
