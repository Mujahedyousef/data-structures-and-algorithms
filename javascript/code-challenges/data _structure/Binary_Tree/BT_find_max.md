## Approach & Efficiency

> in this solution, I depended if I can save the value in the tree in the array. for that, I called pre_order to return an array
after that, I use a map on the array side map I use if to check on the bigger value and compare them.
finally, return the max value


> I use methods:

* pre_order: Big o (n^2)
* map():Big o (n)
