# Stacks and Queues

> Stack is a linear data structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order may be LIFO(Last In First Out) or FILO(First In Last Out).

> Queue is a linear structure that follows a particular order in which the operations are performed. The order is First In First Out (FIFO).

## Challenge

> used types of data structures such as stack and queue and implement many methods on them.

## Approach & Efficiency

>A Stack

* push time complexity =  BigO O(1) &&  space = O(1)

* pop time complexity =  BigO O(1)   &&  space = O(1)
* peek time complexity = BigO O(1)   &&  space = O(1)
* isEmpty time complexity =  BigO O(1)   &&  space = O(1)

> A Queue

* enqueue time complexity =  BigO O(n) &&  space = O(1)
* dequeue time complexity =  BigO O(1) &&  space = O(1)
* peek time complexity =  BigO O(1) &&  space = O(1)
* isEmpty time complexity =  BigO O(1) &&  space = O(1)

## API

>A Stack

> FILO

* push()
* pop()
* peek()
* isEmpty()

> A Queue

* enqueue
* dequeue
* peek
* isEmpty
